# BookVault API

A RESTful API for book discovery, reviews, and analytics, built for COMP3011 Coursework 1 (2025–2026).

BookVault integrates the Goodreads Books dataset (Soumik version, Kaggle) with a user-generated review system, providing endpoints for browsing books, managing reviews, and exploring analytics. The API uses a two-tier rating architecture: dataset ratings from the Goodreads community for large-scale analytics, and user review ratings computed live for personalised recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** SQLite via SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication:** API key via `X-API-Key` header
- **Dataset:** Goodreads Books dataset (~11,000 books)
- **Testing:** pytest with FastAPI TestClient

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bookvault-api.git
cd bookvault-api
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Import the dataset

```bash
python data/import_data.py
```

This loads the Goodreads CSV into `bookvault.db`.

### 4. Run the API

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 5. Run tests

```bash
pip install pytest httpx
pytest tests/test_api.py -v
```

## API Documentation

Interactive Swagger documentation is available at `/docs` when the API is running:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

A PDF export of the API documentation is available at [`docs/api_documentation.pdf`](docs/api_documentation.pdf).

## Authentication

Write endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE) and the user listing endpoint require an `X-API-Key` header. All other GET endpoints are publicly accessible.

To authenticate in Swagger UI, click the "Authorize" button and enter the API key.

## Dataset

The API uses the [Goodreads Books dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) by Soumik from Kaggle. It contains approximately 11,000 books with fields including title, authors, average rating, ISBN, language, page count, ratings count, publication date, and publisher.

## Testing

The test suite uses pytest with FastAPI's TestClient and a separate SQLite test database so that tests never affect production data. Tests cover all CRUD operations, authentication (no key, wrong key, valid key), pagination, search, input validation, and edge cases. Run with:

```bash
pytest tests/test_api.py -v
```
